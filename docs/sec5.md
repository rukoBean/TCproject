# Other Features
If you have experiences with other online databases, you might notice that SpringerLink has a special content type called "Book Series" which is very useful for beginner researchers. In this part, we'll help you exploit this special feature.

## Springer Handbooks Series
As a beginner, you may want to overlook the landscape of a subject before diving in some specific directions. Springer Handbooks Series serve both for this purpose and for your later reference even as an expert. [Click here](https://www.springer.com/series/15558) to access the Springer Handbooks series.

## Lecture Notes Series
When first introduced to a subject, you may encounter some vague and unclear concepts. Some more detailed books from the Lecture Notes Series may be of help. Search `Lecture Notes in <subject>` to access the Lecture Notes Series. Substitute `<subject>` for the subject that you'd like to explore.
