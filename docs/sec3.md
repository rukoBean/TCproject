# How to Search
This part shows how to search and refine your search after successful access to SpringerLink. Before you begin your search, we strongly recommend going back to the old SpringerLink experience by follow these steps:
1. On the SpringerLink homepage, type in some randome search terms and click on the :mag: to the right of the search bar.

![rando](/_media/random.png 'SpringerLink homepage')

2. Click on `You can go back to the old experience here`.

![old](/_media/old.png 'Go back to the old experience')

3. The 'old experience' should look like this.

![old](/_media/oldex.png 'SpringerLink search page')

The reason to go back to the old experience is very simple: the new one is still in the experimental phase and some features are not complete yet.

## Begin Your Search

### Basic Search
SpringerLink offers a search bar at the top of each page. The basic search function is similar to a search engine (for example: Bing and Baidu). Type in keywords and click on the :mag: to submit your search. 

![search bar](/_media/bar.png 'search bar')

Basic search will return results that share the stem(s) of the words you enter in the search box. For example, a search for "running" will return matches that contain "runner", "run", "ran", and so on.

### Advance Search
Basic search has some limits that it will return only results containing all words entered into the search bar, without regard to your access rights to the content. 

Advanced search can be accessed by clicking the cog icon :gear: on the right of the search bar.

Advanced search allows you to search for a DOI, Author or an exact phrase, or perform logical operations with phrases. It also allows you to refine your search even further by only returning results from a specific publication or date range. If you check the `Include Preview-Only content` box, it will only return the results you have access to.

## Read Search Results
The search page is divided into four parts:
1. **Search Bar**. This is where you search with in a search or start a new search.
2. **Include Preview-Only content box**. Uncheck the include preview-only content box if you prefer to see only the content accessible by your institution. By default you see all results displayed.
3. **Left navigation bar**. It shows the following predefined filter options: content type, discipline, sub discipline and language.
4. **Search results**. This is where you can browse search results list and sort the list items.

## Refine Your Search
You can refine your search by the following four methods:
1. **Filter results by access** By default, search results are displayed without regard for your access rights to the content. If you would like to see only results to which you have access, uncheck the Include preview-only content box.

2. **Refine using facet box** The facet boxes that display on the left navigation bar are sets of characteristics that describe the current set of results, with the number next to each item indicating how many results match each characteristic.   
    - Firstly, click "see all" to view and select from all facet items for a particular facet.   
    - Secondly, selecting an item in a facet box will refine your search results so that only those results that fit the selected item remain.

3. **Narrow down by date** You can narrow your results by limiting publish year.   
    - Firstly, click `Date Published` at the top of your search results list.   
    - Secondly, enter different values in the date boxes and click `Submit`.

4. **Search within a search** In order to search within a search, simply **add** keywords to any existing search terms in the search bar and re-submit your search.

## Sort Search Results
Under the default conditions, the search results are sorted according to relevance. They can also be sorted chronologically from new to old or from old to new. You can sort results by selecting between `Relevance`, `Newest First` and `Oldest First` on top of search results list.

Above the search results list you will see an arrow displayed that allows you to download the first 1000 search results as a CSV file.

Search terms and selections will remain as you narrow and expand a search. If you want to start a new search, click `New Search` on the search bar. This will clear the search bar and reset the search page to its default settings.
