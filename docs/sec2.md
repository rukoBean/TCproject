# How to Access
To access an online database generally means you visit the database and log in as a valid user. 
- Personal users can directly log in their accounts. We don't discuss this type of users in this guide.
- Authorized institutional users, according to different spatial locations, have two login methods: **login from campus** or **remote login**.

This part illustrates how to find the link entrance to the SpringerLink platform and how to log in from campus or remotely as an authorized institutional users.
