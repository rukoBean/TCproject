访问方法：访问链接入口、注册登录方法、是否支持校外访问，有几种校外访问方式，如何访问？

To access an online database generally means you visit a link and log in as a valid user. 
- Personal users can directly log in their accounts. We don't discuss this type of users in this guide.
- Authorized institutional users, according to different spatial locations, have two login methods: **login from campus** or **remote login**.

This part illustrates how to find the link entrance to the SpringerLink Platform and how to log in from campus or remotely as an authorized institutional users. For further information, visit [this official support page](https://support.springer.com/en/support/solutions/articles/6000080116-user-access-to-springerlink-and-springer-for-r-d-content).

> [!TIP]
> The platform supports access from desktop computers, laptops, tablets and mobile devices, and it can adapt its size and layout according to different access devices. So use any device at your convenience.

## Campus Login
The IP range of the Southeast University has been authorized by the platform, and users can automatically obtain platform access permissions by connecting to the school or library's network through various devices. 
1. Connect to a Southeast University network (for example: `SEU-WLAN`).
2. Visit SpringerLink.
3. You are already logged in as an institutional user. *Voila!*

If you are not sure whether your current network has been granted authorized access to the SpringerLink platform, here is a simple way to check:
1. Scroll down to the very bottom of the SpringerLink page. 
2. You should be able to find `Southeast University` in the long authorization text like this one.
